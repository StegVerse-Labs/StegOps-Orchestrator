bcat_version: 1.0

module:
  name: StegOps-Orchestrator
  type: automation
  owner: StegVerse-Labs / Orchestrator Maintainers

authority:
  source: StegCore BCAT doctrine + StegCore governance gate
  scope: |
    Orchestrate StegVerse automation (dispatch, scanning, PR creation, repo hygiene),
    while remaining boundary-conditioned, explainable, and revocable.
  renewal_required: true

trust_continuity:
  assumptions:
    - Tokens/secrets used by this repo remain least-privilege and scoped
    - Dispatch targets are explicitly allowlisted (no implicit cross-repo reach)
    - Inputs are validated and unsafe operations require explicit human review
    - Orchestrator actions are auditable via Git history and workflow summaries
  continuity_signals:
    - BCAT Gate passes on PR/push and bcat.yaml is present
    - No new cross-repo targets added without allowlist update
    - Workflows emit a visible BCAT_STATUS (GRANTED/CONSTRAINED/DENIED)
  break_conditions:
    - Any cross-repo operation occurs without allowlist membership
    - Any privileged token scope expands without doctrine-linked review
    - Any workflow treats refusal as failure instead of explainable success
    - Any “temporary bypass” exists without explicit sunset and audit trail

boundary_conditions:
  operational:
    - Refuse if required secrets/vars are missing or invalid
    - Refuse if target repo is not allowlisted
    - Refuse if action would mutate without an auditable PR trail (unless explicitly approved)
  temporal:
    - Constrain if run occurs outside defined maintenance window (if configured)
    - Constrain if repeated failures indicate boundary pressure (rate limits, API errors)
  contextual:
    - Refuse if environment/context mismatch is detected (e.g., intended main vs other branch)
    - Constrain if running in unknown/untested context (e.g., fork PR without permissions)

degradation_behavior:
  modes: [constrain, refuse]
  explanation_required: true

human_accountability:
  custodian: Orchestrator Maintainers
  escalation_path: GitHub Issues in StegOps-Orchestrator + ping StegCore maintainers for boundary changes

non_action_policy:
  refusal_is_success: true
  explanation_required: true

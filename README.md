# StegOps-Orchestrator

StegOps-Orchestrator is an AI-powered operations assistant that lives **inside your GitHub repo**.

It automatically:
- organizes conversations, notes, and docs
- tracks what is current vs stale
- preserves decision history
- produces a continuous operational status report

No dashboards. No meetings. No lock-in.

## Why StegOps Exists

Most teams lose context faster than they lose code.

Decisions are scattered across:
- issues
- pull requests
- chats
- documents
- “temporary” notes that become permanent

StegOps creates **operational memory**.

## What It Produces

- **Archive log**
  A timestamped record of what changed, when, and why.

- **STATUS.md**
  A live snapshot of what is up to date vs stale.

- **Continuity**
  New contributors can understand *why things are the way they are*.

All outputs are plain Markdown files you own.

## Who This Is For

- Solo founders
- Small engineering teams
- Open-source maintainers
- Regulated or audit-sensitive projects

If your work lives in GitHub, StegOps fits.

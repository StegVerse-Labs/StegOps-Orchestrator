# What We Do

StegVerse delivers short, high-impact audits that reveal where **AI systems, governance structures, and credentialed automation** will fail under real-world pressure.

We focus on the gaps that are hardest to see until it's too late—where responsibility is fragmented and assumptions pile up:
- AI behavior vs oversight
- Governance vs operations
- Trust boundaries and credential drift
- Auditability & recovery integrity

We are not a tool vendor or managed service. We deliver executive clarity.

# StegVerse

**Expose trust failures before they become incidents.**

StegVerse is a trust, governance, and resilience lab focused on identifying where modern systems silently fail—especially when AI and automation move faster than oversight.

Most organizations assume:
- AI behaves as designed
- credentials remain trustworthy
- automation stays accountable
- audit trails survive failure

In practice, these assumptions regularly break—often quietly—until an incident forces scrutiny and the ability to explain what happened is already compromised.

---

## What we do

We deliver short, senior-only **Trust & Risk Systems Audits** that surface:
- AI & automation failure modes
- governance defensibility gaps
- credential and trust-boundary breaks
- auditability and recovery integrity risks

---

## Outcomes you can take to a board

- Clear, evidence-based findings
- A prioritized risk register
- A practical remediation roadmap
- Board-ready briefing materials

---

## Confidential, time-boxed engagements

Most audits complete in **2–3 weeks** and are designed to create clarity with minimal disruption.

---

## How engagements begin

StegVerse engagements start with a confidential, asynchronous intake.

- No sales calls
- No broad discovery sessions
- Senior-only participation

To request an audit or discuss fit:

- **Open a request on GitHub:** use the StegOps intake issue template  
- **Or email:** **ops@stegverse.org**

---

## Not a fit

StegVerse is not a fit for:
- teams seeking general AI tooling
- checkbox compliance exercises
- broad organizational training programs

This work is focused, technical, and accountability-driven.

- auto-close stale leads
- invoice draft generation (on command)
- lead workspaces (`/leads/issue-*`)
- monthly dashboards (`/dashboards/`)
- continuity logs and run state

If you are here for services and pricing:
- **Services:** `site/services.md`
- **Pricing:** `site/pricing.md`

# StegVerse

**Expose trust failures before they become incidents.**

StegVerse is a trust, governance, and resilience lab focused on identifying where modern systems silently fail—especially when AI and automation move faster than oversight.

Most organizations assume:
- AI behaves as designed
- Credentials remain trustworthy
- Automation stays accountable
- Audit trails survive failure

In practice, these assumptions regularly break—often quietly—until an incident forces scrutiny and the ability to explain what happened is already compromised.

## What we do
We deliver short, senior-only **Trust & Risk Systems Audits** that surface:
- AI & automation failure modes
- Governance defensibility gaps
- Credential and trust-boundary breaks
- Auditability and recovery integrity risks

## Outcomes you can take to a board
- Clear, evidence-based findings
- A prioritized risk register
- A practical remediation roadmap
- Board-ready briefing materials

## Confidential, time-boxed engagements
Most audits complete in **2–3 weeks** and are designed to create clarity with minimal disruption.

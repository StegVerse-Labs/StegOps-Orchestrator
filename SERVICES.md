# StegOps — AI Operations & Knowledge Continuity

StegOps is an AI-powered operations and knowledge orchestration service that automatically
organizes, summarizes, and tracks the operational state of a project over time.

It is designed for founders, small teams, and regulated environments that need clarity,
continuity, and auditability — without meetings or dashboards.

---

## What StegOps Does

- Automatically archives notes, chats, documents, and conversations
- Classifies information as active work or historical reference
- Tracks what files, docs, and workflows are current vs stale
- Maintains a time-based audit trail of decisions and changes
- Produces a continuously updated operational status report

Everything runs asynchronously.

# StegOps — AI Operations & Knowledge Continuity

StegOps is an AI-powered operations assistant that automatically:
- organizes messy notes, chats, issues, and docs
- tracks what is current vs stale
- maintains an audit trail of decisions and operational state

Designed for founders, small teams, and regulated environments.

## Core Capabilities

- **AI Archiving**
  Drop files, notes, or conversations — StegOps classifies and stores them intelligently.

- **Operational Status Tracking**
  Automatically reports what files, docs, and workflows are out of date.

- **Continuity & Audit Trail**
  Every change is logged. Every run produces a timestamped operational snapshot.

- **Async by Design**
  No meetings. No dashboards. Everything runs automatically.
